# Monokai for Azure Data Studio

Monokai theme for Azure Data Studio.

It's a really simple port, using Dark+ (default VSCode theme) for the window theme and Monokai for the editor theme.

You can install it by downloading the .vsix file and then with Azure Data Studio open, open the Command Prompt (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`

## Based on

- The original Monokai Theme
- The original VsCode Theme
